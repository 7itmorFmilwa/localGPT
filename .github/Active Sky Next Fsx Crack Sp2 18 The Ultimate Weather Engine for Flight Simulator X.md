When the dollar price of gold goes down, it means that people value gold less than before, because there is more of it available. This is based on the law of marginal utility, which is a principle that explains how people act. According to this law, the more of something you have, the less you value each additional unit of it, all else being equal. Therefore, when gold becomes less valuable to people, they will exchange it for more of other goods, such as dollars. In other words: the dollar price of gold falls.

The dollar price of gold is not fixed by any authority. It is determined by the supply and demand of gold in the market. The supply of gold depends on how much gold is mined, stored, and sold by various actors, such as governments, central banks, mining companies, and individuals. The demand for gold depends on how much people want to use gold for various purposes, such as jewelry, investment, or money.
  
When the supply of gold increases faster than the demand for gold, the dollar price of gold falls. This means that people can buy more gold with the same amount of dollars, or sell less gold to get the same amount of dollars. Conversely, when the demand for gold increases faster than the supply of gold, the dollar price of gold rises. This means that people can buy less gold with the same amount of dollars, or sell more gold to get the same amount of dollars.
  
The dollar price of gold also affects the value of the dollar itself. When the dollar price of gold falls, it means that the dollar becomes stronger relative to gold. This means that the dollar can buy more goods and services in the market, or that it takes fewer dollars to buy a given amount of goods and services. Conversely, when the dollar price of gold rises, it means that the dollar becomes weaker relative to gold. This means that the dollar can buy less goods and services in the market, or that it takes more dollars to buy a given amount of goods and services.
  
The dollar price of gold is influenced by many factors, such as inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. Inflation is the general increase in the prices of goods and services over time. When inflation is high, the purchasing power of the dollar declines, and people may seek to preserve their wealth by buying gold. This increases the demand for gold and raises its dollar price. Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money. When interest rates are low, the opportunity cost of holding gold decreases, and people may prefer to invest in gold rather than in other assets that yield low returns. This also increases the demand for gold and raises its dollar price.
  
Geopolitical events are events that affect the stability and security of countries and regions. When there is political turmoil, war, or uncertainty in the world, people may lose confidence in governments and currencies, and seek to protect themselves by buying gold. This creates a flight to safety and increases the demand for gold and its dollar price. Market sentiment is the overall mood and attitude of investors and consumers. When there is optimism, confidence, and risk appetite in the market, people may favor other assets that offer higher returns and growth potential than gold. This reduces the demand for gold and lowers its dollar price.
  
The dollar price of gold has implications for various sectors and industries in the economy. For example, a high dollar price of gold benefits gold producers, such as mining companies, who can sell their output at a higher profit margin. It also benefits gold holders, such as investors, who can sell their holdings at a higher value. On the other hand, a high dollar price of gold hurts gold consumers, such as jewelry makers, who have to pay more for their raw materials. It also hurts non-gold holders, such as savers, who see their wealth eroded by inflation.
