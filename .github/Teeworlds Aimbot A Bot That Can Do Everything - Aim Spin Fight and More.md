## Step 1: Download an Aimbot Program
 
There are many aimbot programs available for Teeworlds, but not all of them are safe or reliable. Some of them might contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Others might not work properly or be detected by anti-cheat systems.
 
One of the most popular and trusted aimbot programs for Teeworlds is Bla-Client[^3^], which is a modified version of the official Teeworlds client with additional features and options. Bla-Client has a built-in aimbot that can be activated by pressing a hotkey. It also has other cheats such as wallhack, flyhack, speedhack, and more.
 
To download Bla-Client, go to this link[^3^] and follow the instructions on the forum post. You will need to register an account on the Teeworlds forum to access the download link. You will also need to download and install Git for Windows[^1^] and CMake[^1^] to compile the source code of Bla-Client.
 
## Step 2: Configure and Run Bla-Client
 
After downloading and extracting Bla-Client, open the folder and run cmake .. in a terminal window. This will generate a Visual Studio solution file that you can open with Microsoft Visual Studio (as of writing, MSVS Community 2017). Build the solution by pressing F7 or selecting Build â Build Solution from the menu.
 
Once the build is complete, you will find two executable files in the build folder: teeworlds.exe and teeworlds\_srv.exe. The first one is the client that you will use to play the game, and the second one is the server that you can use to host your own game.
 
Before running teeworlds.exe, you might want to configure some settings for the aimbot and other cheats. To do this, open the settings.cfg file in a text editor (such as Notepad) and edit the values according to your preferences. For example, you can change the aimbot hotkey (cl\_aimkey), the aimbot mode (cl\_aimmode), the aimbot range (cl\_aimrange), and more. You can find a detailed explanation of each setting on this page[^3^].
 
After saving your settings, run teeworlds.exe and join a server of your choice. To activate the aimbot, press the hotkey that you set in the settings.cfg file (by default, it is F8). You will see a message on the screen saying "Aimbot enabled". To disable it, press the hotkey again.
 
## Step 3: Enjoy Your Unfair Advantage
 
Now that you have enabled the aimbot, you can enjoy dominating your opponents with ease. The aimbot will automatically lock onto any enemy that comes into your range and shoot them with perfect accuracy. You can also use other cheats such as wallhack to see through walls, flyhack to fly around the map, speedhack to move faster than normal, and more.
 
However, be careful not to be too obvious or suspicious when using an aimbot or other cheats. Other players might notice your unnatural behavior and report you to the server admin or moderator. If you get caught cheating, you
