## What is MBR Regenerator?
 
MBR Regenerator is a freeware application developed by Josh Cell Software that can repair the MBR of Windows 7 computers. It can also recover and restore the activation system of Windows 7, by installing the trial key and rebuilding the tokens. This way, you can avoid activation errors and problems caused by corrupted files.
 
MBR Regenerator can also inject vital core files that the system needs to function properly, such as shell32.dll and explorer.exe. It can also rearm your Windows 7 installation, which means resetting the activation grace period to 30 days.
 
MBR Regenerator is compatible with all editions of Windows 7, both 32-bit and 64-bit. However, it does not work on other versions of Windows, such as Windows XP or Windows 10.
 
## How does MBR Regenerator work?
 
MBR Regenerator works by rewriting the original boot loader code on the MBR sector of your hard drive. This way, it replaces the corrupted or infected code with a fixed one, which allows your computer to boot again.
 
MBR Regenerator also uses the WinSxS directory, which stores an image of all essential operating system files for later restore. It gathers important instructions to restore these files properly, using a technology called Dll Injection.
 
MBR Regenerator can also regenerate the operating system by running a fix without touching the activation area if it is not selected. This option can help you restore your system files without affecting your activation status.

## Conclusion
 
MBR Regenerator is a useful tool that can help you repair your Windows 7 boot sector and recover your activation system. It is easy to use and does not require any installation or registration.
