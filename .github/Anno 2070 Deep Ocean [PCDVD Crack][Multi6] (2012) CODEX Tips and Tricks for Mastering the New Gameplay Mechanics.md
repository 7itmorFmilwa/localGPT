# Anno 2070 Deep Ocean: A Review of the Expansion Pack
 
Anno 2070 Deep Ocean is the first and only expansion pack for Anno 2070, the futuristic city-building and strategy game developed by Blue Byte and Related Designs. It was released on October 4, 2012, and adds a new civilization level, new buildings, new resources, new vehicles, new challenges, and new gameplay features to the base game.
 
The main attraction of Anno 2070 Deep Ocean is the exploration and exploitation of the underwater world. Players can now build underwater cities on submerged plateaus, using geothermal energy as a new power source. The underwater environment offers new industries, such as coral breeding, enzyme production, and deep sea mining. It also introduces new resources, such as lithium, platinum, sponges, and coral.

The expansion pack also introduces a new population class for the Tech faction: the Geniuses. These highly intelligent and demanding citizens require advanced goods, such as neuroimplants, immunity drugs, laboratory instruments, and bionic suits. To produce these goods, players need to use both underwater and above-water production chains, making the game more complex and challenging. The Geniuses also unlock the Tech monument: the Science Forum, which grants special abilities and bonuses to the player.
 
Anno 2070 Deep Ocean also adds new content and features to the other factions and aspects of the game. For example, there are new ornamental buildings for the Techs, new missions and quests for the campaign and scenarios modes, new disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes, new achievements and medals, new items and upgrades, and a new co-op mode that allows players to share islands and resources.
 
Anno 2070 Deep Ocean is a must-have for fans of Anno 2070 who want to experience more depth and variety in their gameplay. It offers hours of fun and challenge in building and managing futuristic underwater cities. It also enhances the graphics and sound of the game with stunning underwater visuals and effects. Anno 2070 Deep Ocean is available as a downloadable content on Steam for $19.99 or as part of the Anno 2070 Complete Edition for $29.99[^1^].
  
## How to Play Anno 2070 Deep Ocean
 
Anno 2070 Deep Ocean can be played as a standalone expansion pack or as an integrated part of the base game. To access the new content, players need to have at least one Tech city with 1200 Researchers. This will unlock the new Genius population class and the ability to build underwater cities. Players can also start a new continuous game with the Deep Ocean settings, which will allow them to choose the Tech faction from the beginning and have access to underwater islands from the start.
 
The gameplay of Anno 2070 Deep Ocean is similar to the base game, but with some new twists and challenges. Players need to balance the needs and demands of their citizens, both above and below water, while managing their economy, ecology, diplomacy, and military. The underwater world offers new opportunities and risks, such as geothermal energy plants that can cause earthquakes, coral reefs that can boost eco-balance, and tsunamis that can wipe out coastal buildings. Players also need to deal with new enemies and allies, such as Hiro Ebashi, the leader of the Techs, Rufus Thorne, the CEO of Global Trust, and Yana Rodriguez, the leader of the Ecos.
 
## Tips and Tricks for Anno 2070 Deep Ocean
 
Anno 2070 Deep Ocean is a complex and challenging game that requires careful planning and strategy. Here are some tips and tricks to help you succeed in your underwater adventure:
 
- Use transport submarines to move goods between islands and underwater plateaus. They are faster and more efficient than cargo ships.
- Build defense platforms on your underwater islands to protect them from enemy attacks. They can also house aircrafts that can patrol your territory.
- Upgrade your Tech buildings with items and modules to increase their productivity and efficiency. You can find items by completing missions, exploring ruins, or trading with other factions.
- Use geothermal energy plants sparingly and carefully. They provide a lot of power, but they also increase seismic activity and lower eco-balance. You can mitigate these effects by building stabilizers or using items.
- Build coral breeders and enzyme factories near coral reefs to boost their output. Coral reefs also improve eco-balance and attract fish schools.
- Use deep sea mining stations to extract rare resources from underwater deposits. You can use these resources to produce advanced goods or trade them for a high profit.
- Build monuments to unlock special abilities and bonuses. The Science Forum allows you to build any building on any island, regardless of faction or population level. The Eden Project improves eco-balance and fertility on all islands. The Corporate Headquarters increases tax income and trade volume.
