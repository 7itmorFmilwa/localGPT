The film revolves around the discovery of a duplicate Earth in the solar system, and the tragic accident that connects the lives of an ambitious young student and an accomplished composer. Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling) is a brilliant 17-year-old girl who has been accepted into MIT. On the night of the discovery of the twin Earth, she drives home intoxicated and crashes into a car carrying John Burroughs (William Mapother), his pregnant wife and young son. John survives but his family dies. Rhoda serves four years in prison and becomes a janitor at her former high school. She also enters an essay contest sponsored by a millionaire entrepreneur who is offering a civilian space flight to the other Earth.
 
One day, Rhoda sees John laying a toy at the accident site. She visits his house, intending to apologize, but pretends to be a maid offering a free day of cleaning as a marketing tool for a cleaning service. John, who has dropped out of his Yale music faculty position, has been letting his home and himself go, and accepts Rhoda's offer. They develop a caring relationship and eventually have sex. Rhoda wins the essay contest and is chosen to be one of the first to travel to the other Earth. John asks her not to go, believing they might have a future together. She finally decides to tell him the truth about who she is. He is upset and throws her out of the house.
 
Rhoda hears an astrophysicist talking on television, describing a "broken mirror" hypothesis which states that upon the sighting of the twin-Earth the synchronicity of events happening in both the earths was broken. Rhoda rushes back to John's house, but he refuses to let her in. She leaves him her ticket for the space flight and drives away. As she looks up at the sky, she sees a shuttle launch. The film ends with Rhoda standing face-to-face with her doppelgÃ¤nger from Earth Two.

Some critics compared the film favorably to other low-budget sci-fi films such as Primer and Moon. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it \"a film animated by one stunning image: A new planet four times the size of the moon appears in the sky of Earth.\" He also praised Marling's performance and Cahill's direction, writing, \"What a debut for Mike Cahill and Brit Marling. They've made a smart and touching film that reaches for the stars and doesn't have all the answers.\"[^1^] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was less impressed, giving the film two stars out of five and criticizing its \"strange, gloomy, moderately acted damp squib of a movie.\" He also found the premise implausible and the ending predictable.[^3^]
 
Another Earth was nominated for several awards, including two Independent Spirit Awards for Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay. It also won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, which honors films that focus on science or technology as a theme. The film also sparked interest from NASA, which invited Cahill and Marling to visit the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and discuss the science behind the film.
