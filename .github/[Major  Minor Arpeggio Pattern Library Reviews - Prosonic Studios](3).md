## What are arpeggios and why are they important?
  
Arpeggios are musical patterns that consist of playing the notes of a chord one by one, instead of all at once. They are often used to create melodies, harmonies, bass lines, and solos. Arpeggios can add variety, interest, and emotion to your music. They can also help you improve your musical skills, such as ear training, chord knowledge, and finger technique.
