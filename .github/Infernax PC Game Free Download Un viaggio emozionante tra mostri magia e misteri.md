If you are a fan of old-school action platformers with pixel graphics, branching paths, and multiple endings, you might want to check out Infernax, a new game from Berzerk Studio and The Arcade Crew. Infernax is a metroidvania game that follows the adventures of a knight who returns to his homeland only to find it cursed by unholy magic. You will have to explore a vast open world, fight against ruthless enemies, and make crucial decisions that will affect the outcome of your quest.

Infernax is not a game for the faint of heart. It is a challenging and unforgiving game that will make you die a lot. The game has a permadeath system that means you will lose all your progress if you die, unless you find and activate a checkpoint. The checkpoints are scarce and hidden, so you will have to explore carefully and be prepared for anything. The game also has a hunger system that forces you to eat food regularly or suffer from penalties. You will have to manage your resources wisely and plan your strategy.
 
The game's combat is fast-paced and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and skills to use. You can slash, stab, shoot, and cast spells at your enemies, as well as dodge, block, and parry their attacks. You will face different types of enemies, from zombies and skeletons to giant spiders and dragons. Each enemy has its own behavior and weakness, so you will have to adapt your tactics accordingly. The game also features many boss battles that will test your skills and patience.
 
The game's graphics are retro-style pixel art that evoke the nostalgia of the 8-bit era. The game has a colorful and detailed world, with different environments and atmospheres. You will explore forests, caves, castles, dungeons, and more. The game also has a dynamic lighting system that creates shadows and effects. The game's sound is also well-done, with catchy music and sound effects that match the action.
