Muhajirnama is a collection of poems by Munawwar Rana, a renowned Urdu poet who was born in India and migrated to Pakistan after the partition of 1947.

The poems are written in a simple and lucid language, but convey deep and profound meanings. They touch upon various themes such as identity, belonging, loss, memory, love, faith, and hope. They also express the poet's admiration and gratitude for his adopted homeland, Pakistan, and his longing and respect for his ancestral land, India.
