The game is played on a board with six different regions, each representing a different fear: spiders, clowns, ghosts, zombies, vampires and werewolves. Each player chooses a character card and a fear card, which determines their starting region and their personal fear. The goal is to collect six keys from the different regions and return to the Well of Fears in the center of the board before 49 minutes are up. But beware: El Guardian will randomly appear on the DVD screen and give you instructions, penalties or surprises that will affect your progress. You might have to answer a trivia question, perform a dare, skip a turn or face your worst fear. If you fail to obey El Guardian or pause the DVD, you will be banished to the Black Hole and lose a key.
 
Atmosfear El Guardian is a game that combines strategy, luck and courage. It is suitable for 3 to 6 players aged 12 and up. It is available in Spanish and English versions. You can download the DVD from the official website or buy it online. If you are ready to face your fears and have some fun with your friends, get Atmosfear El Guardian today!
