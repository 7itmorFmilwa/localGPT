If you have a PCI parallel card with a WCH CH350L chipset and you need to install the driver for it, you may find it hard to locate the correct one online. The WCH website[^1^] offers various drivers for different models of PCI cards, but none of them seems to match the CH350L exactly. However, there is a way to install the driver successfully and make your parallel card work.
 
Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download the CH35XDRV.EXE file from the WCH website[^1^]. This is a driver installation package and EEPROM configuration tool for CH351/CH352/CH353/CH355/CH356/CH358/CH359 PCI cards. It supports 32/64-bit Windows 11/10/8.1/8/7/VISTA/XPï¼SERVER 2022/2019/2016/2012/2008/2003ï¼2000/NT4.0/ME/98 DOS and Linuxï¼Microsoft WHQL Certified.
2. Run the CH35XDRV.EXE file and follow the instructions to install the driver. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
3. Open the Device Manager and locate your PCI parallel card under Ports (COM & LPT). It should be labeled as CH35X PCI=>PARALLEL or something similar.
4. Right-click on your PCI parallel card and select Properties. Go to the Driver tab and click on Update Driver.
5. Select Browse my computer for driver software and then Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer.
6. Uncheck Show compatible hardware and scroll down to find WCH in the Manufacturer list. Select it and then choose CH35X PCI=>PARALLEL from the Model list. Click Next and then Close.
7. Your PCI parallel card should now be updated with the correct driver and ready to use.

I hope this helps you install your WCH CH350L PCI parallel card driver 36. If you have any questions or problems, please let me know.

- Connect your parallel device (such as a printer, scanner, or external hard drive) to the parallel port on your PCI card. Make sure the device is turned on and ready to use.
- Open the Control Panel and go to Devices and Printers. You should see your parallel device listed there. If not, try refreshing the page or restarting your computer.
- Right-click on your parallel device and select Printer Properties (or Properties if it is not a printer). Go to the Ports tab and check that the correct port is selected. It should be something like LPT1: CH35X PCI=>PARALLEL.
- Try printing a test page (or scanning or copying if it is not a printer) and see if it works. If not, check the troubleshooting section below.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and tested your WCH CH350L PCI parallel card driver 36. You can now enjoy using your parallel device with your computer.

If you encounter any problems with your WCH CH350L PCI parallel card driver 36, here are some possible solutions:

- Make sure your PCI card is inserted properly in the PCI slot on your motherboard. You may need to open your computer case and check the connection.
- Make sure your parallel device is compatible with your PCI card and your operating system. You may need to check the device manual or the manufacturer's website for more information.
- Make sure your parallel cable is in good condition and securely connected to both ends. You may need to replace the cable if it is damaged or faulty.
- Make sure you have the latest version of the driver installed. You can download it from the WCH website or use the Windows Update feature to check for updates.
- Try uninstalling and reinstalling the driver. You can use the CH35XDRV.EXE file to do that or use the Device Manager to remove the driver and then scan for hardware changes.
- Try using a different PCI slot or a different computer if possible. This can help you determine if the problem is with your PCI card, your motherboard, or your computer.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact WCH or your PCI card vendor for further assistance. They may be able to provide you with more technical support or a replacement product.
