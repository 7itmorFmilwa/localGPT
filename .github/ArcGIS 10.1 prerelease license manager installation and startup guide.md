In this article, we will show you how to install and configure the ArcGIS 10.1 prerelease license manager on your server in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download the ArcGIS 10.1 Prerelease License Manager
 
To download the ArcGIS 10.1 prerelease license manager, you need to have an Esri account and be invited to participate in the ArcGIS 10.1 prerelease program.

The download page will provide you with a link to download the installation file for the license manager, as well as a license file that contains your authorization codes for ArcGIS 10.1 prerelease products. You need to save both files on your server.
 
## Step 2: Install the ArcGIS 10.1 Prerelease License Manager
 
To install the ArcGIS 10.1 prerelease license manager, you need to run the installation file that you downloaded in step 1. The installation wizard will guide you through the installation process, which involves accepting the license agreement, choosing the installation folder, and confirming the installation settings.

## Step 3: Configure the ArcGIS 10.1 Prerelease License Manager
