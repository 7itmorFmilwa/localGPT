The Hall algorithm emulates a large hall with a broad and warm reverb, suitable for vocals, orchestral instruments and ambient sounds. The Room algorithm emulates a small and well-furnished room with an intimate ambience, ideal for drums, guitars and keyboards. The Plate algorithm emulates the large metallic plates that were used to create reverbs before digital signal processing was commonplace, giving you a classic and dense reverb sound that works well with vocals, guitars and percussion.
 
The plugin also has some common controls that affect all algorithms, such as Pre Delay, Decay, Hi Color and Mix. Pre Delay lets you adjust the time between the direct sound and the onset of the reverb tail, creating a sense of distance and depth. Decay lets you adjust the length of the reverb tail, from short and snappy to long and lush. Hi Color lets you vary the "color" of the reverb, from dark and warm to bright and crisp. Mix lets you set the wet/dry balance, from subtle enhancement to full immersion.
 
The plugin is available as a natively running VST/AU plugin for Windows and Mac, as well as part of the monitor signal path of the Desktop Konnekt audio interface. The plugin is easy to use and has a simple and intuitive interface, with a large graphical display that shows you the shape of the reverb tail. The plugin also has a handy 100% knob that lets you quickly switch to 100% wet signal for parallel processing.
