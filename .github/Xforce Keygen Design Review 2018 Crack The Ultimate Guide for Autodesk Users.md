## Viewing Files
  
To open a file in Design Review 2018, you can either drag and drop it from your file explorer to the Design Review window, or click File > Open and browse to the file location. You can also use the free online viewer for DWF files only[^1^]. Once the file is opened, you can use the navigation tools on the toolbar or the mouse to zoom, pan, rotate, orbit, and walk through the model. You can also use the View Cube and the Navigation Bar to change the view orientation and perspective[^1^].
  
## Measuring Files
  
To measure parts, areas, surfaces, and dimensions of a file, you can use the Measure tools on the toolbar. You can choose from different measurement modes, such as point-to-point distance, angle between two lines, radius of a circle, area of a polygon, and more[^1^]. You can also snap to geometry points or enter precise values for more accurate measurements. The measurement results are displayed on the screen and can be copied to the clipboard or saved as a text file[^1^].
  
## Marking Up and Annotating Files
  
To add comments, information, and suggestions for design changes to a file, you can use the Mark Up tools on the toolbar. You can choose from different mark up types, such as text, callout, cloud, stamp, symbol, highlighter, line, arrow, rectangle, ellipse, polygon, freehand sketch, and more[^1^]. You can also customize the properties of each mark up type, such as color, font size, line width, fill style, etc. The mark ups are stored in a separate layer that can be turned on or off[^1^].
  
## Printing Files
  
To print a file or a selected view of a file, you can click File > Print or press Ctrl+P. You can choose from different print options, such as printer name, paper size, orientation, scale, margins, and more[^1^]. You can also preview the print output before printing. Design Review 2018 preserves the print fidelity of the original design software[^1^].

## Tracking and Importing Changes
  
To manage, track, and import changes back to the original design software, you can use the Change Manager tool on the toolbar. You can compare two versions of a file and see the differences highlighted in different colors. You can also review the mark ups and comments made by other reviewers and accept or reject them. You can then export the changes as a DWF file that can be imported back to the original design software to complete the review cycle[^1^].

It is compatible with various file formats and offers many features and tools to enhance your design review process.
