- Dynamic machine control: This feature allows you to modify the orientation and position of your machine tool in real time, without affecting the toolpath geometry. This can help you avoid collisions, reduce tool lengths, and improve accessibility.
- Optimized roughing: This feature allows you to create efficient and smooth roughing toolpaths that can remove large amounts of material quickly and safely. You can also use adaptive clearing strategies that can adjust the feed rate and stepover according to the material conditions.
- High-speed finishing: This feature allows you to create high-quality finishing toolpaths that can achieve smooth and accurate surfaces. You can also use advanced strategies such as constant-Z, spiral, flowline, and rest machining.
- Simulation and verification: This feature allows you to simulate and verify your toolpaths before sending them to the machine. You can check for errors, collisions, gouges, and excess material. You can also view the simulation in different modes, such as wireframe, solid, or shaded.
