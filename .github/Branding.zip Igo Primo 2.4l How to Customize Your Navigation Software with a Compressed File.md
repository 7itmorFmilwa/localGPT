However, not all branding.zip files are compatible with Igo Primo 2.4l. Some branding.zip files are designed for other versions of Igo or other navigation software such as Amigo[^1^]. To use a branding.zip file for Igo Primo 2.4l, you need to make sure that it is compatible with your software version and that it contains the necessary files and folders.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use a branding.zip file for Igo Primo 2.4l in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download a compatible branding.zip file

Alternatively, you can create your own branding.zip file by using a tool such as GROconvert.exe[^1^], which can convert branding.gro files (used by Amigo) to branding.zip files (used by Igo Primo 2.4l). However, this requires some technical skills and knowledge of the structure and content of the branding.zip file.
 
## Step 2: Copy the branding.zip file to your device
 
The next step is to copy the branding.zip file to your device where you have installed Igo Primo 2.4l.

## Step 3: Restart your device and launch Igo Primo 2.4l
 
The final step is to restart your device and launch Igo Primo 2.4l. The software should automatically detect the branding.zip file and apply the changes to the user interface.
