Shaderlight offers two rendering modes: progressive and single shot. Progressive mode allows you to see your image develop on screen as you continue to refine your SketchUp model. You can zoom and pan to explore the details of your image or capture your work in progress with the snapshot feature. Single shot mode is ideal for production renders, as it renders your image in one go with the highest quality.
 
Shaderlight also has a material editor that applies the most suitable Shaderlight parameters to SketchUp's library materials. You can then fine-tune the materials by adjusting the type, finish, and bump map. You can also apply realistic lighting and accurate shadows to your model with Shaderlight's physically based lighting features and advanced global illumination techniques.

One of the most unique features of Shaderlight is the Replace Me feature, which lets you replace simple placeholder objects in your SketchUp model with more detailed models from the Shaderlight library. This way, you can save time and memory while rendering complex scenes with trees, people, cars, and more. You can also create your own Replace Me objects and add them to the library for future use.
  
Shaderlight also supports SketchUp scene animation, which means you can render your SketchUp scenes as a sequence of images or a video file. You can use SketchUp's scene tabs to create different views of your model and then use Shaderlight's animation settings to control the frame rate, output format, and quality of your animation. You can also add effects such as depth of field, exposure, and background image to enhance your animation.
