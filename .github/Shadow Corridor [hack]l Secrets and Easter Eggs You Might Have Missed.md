## What You Need to Hack Shadow Corridor
 
Before you start hacking Shadow Corridor, you will need a few things:
 
- A PC with Windows 10 64-bit operating system.
- A copy of Shadow Corridor on Steam. You can buy it for $7.99 or download it for free from some online sources[^1^] [^2^].
- A hex editor program. This is a software that allows you to edit the binary data of any file. You can use any hex editor you like, but we recommend HxD, which is free and easy to use.
- A backup of your Shadow Corridor save file. This is very important, because hacking can sometimes corrupt or delete your progress. You can find your save file in C:\Users\YourName\AppData\LocalLow\SpaceOnigiriGameLLC\ShadowCorridor. Copy and paste it somewhere safe before you proceed.

## How to Hack Shadow Corridor
 
Now that you have everything ready, let's get started with hacking Shadow Corridor. Here are some of the things you can hack in the game:
 
### Hack Your Inventory
 
One of the most useful hacks in Shadow Corridor is to modify your inventory. You can add any item you want, such as keys, flashlights, weapons, masks, etc. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open your hex editor program and load your save file.
2. Search for the hex value 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01. This is the beginning of your inventory data.
3. The next 16 bytes after this value represent the first item slot in your inventory. Each item has a unique hex code that identifies it. For example, the code for the flashlight is 01 00 00 00.
4. To change the item in the first slot, simply replace the existing code with the code of the item you want. For example, if you want to have a katana in the first slot, replace the code with 0A 00 00 00.
5. You can repeat this process for the other slots in your inventory. Just remember that each slot has 16 bytes of data, and that you can only have up to 8 items in your inventory at a time.
6. Save your changes and exit the hex editor program.
7. Launch Shadow Corridor and load your save file. You should see your hacked inventory in the game.
