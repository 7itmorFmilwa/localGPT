The Panchatantra stories are among the oldest and most popular collections of fables in the world. They were originally written in Sanskrit by Vishnu Sharma, a sage and teacher, who used them to educate three young princes in the art of governance and life. The stories are full of animals, humans and gods who interact in various situations and teach moral lessons. The stories are divided into five books: Mitra-bheda (The Loss of Friends), Mitra-lÄbha (The Gaining of Friends), KÄkolÅ«kÄ«yam (Of Crows and Owls), Labdhapraá¹ÄÅam (Loss Of Gains) and AparÄ«ká¹£itakÄrakaá¹ (Ill-Considered Actions).
 
The Panchatantra stories have been translated into many languages and cultures over the centuries. They have influenced the literature and folklore of India, Persia, Arabia, Greece, Europe and beyond. They have also inspired many modern works of art, such as movies, cartoons, comics, games and songs. Some of the famous adaptations of the Panchatantra stories are The Arabian Nights, The Fables of Aesop, The Fables of La Fontaine, The Jungle Book, The Lion King and Zootopia.
 
The Panchatantra stories are not only entertaining but also educational. They teach us valuable lessons about friendship, loyalty, courage, wisdom, justice, compassion and more. They also show us the consequences of greed, envy, pride, anger and folly. They help us to understand ourselves and others better and to cope with the challenges and opportunities of life. They are timeless treasures that can enrich our minds and hearts.
